If there are multiple types of box that one can add, it will pop up a modal window which allows you to select the type by typing a number.\np adds a port to the box that the cursor is hovering over. If there are multiple types of port, then again a window will pop up which allows you to select the type of port that you want to add.\ns sets a port or box to be the current \"source\". When you select the source, it should turn light blue.\nt sets a port or box to be the current \"target\". When you select the target it should turn light red.\nw adds a new wire, using the ports/boxes selected as source and target. If there is no wire type compatible with the source/target pair, then this will remove the selection of source/target and not add a wire. If there is more than one wire type that could be added, it will pop up a modal asking you which type of wire you wish to add.\nd deletes the port or box under the cursor. Note: there is currently no way to delete wires other than deleting their source/target. Will fix this soon.\nS saves the semagram, which means that it sends the semagram from javascript back to Julia. You must do this before going on to the next step.
