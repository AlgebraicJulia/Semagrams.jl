Press "?" for a short list of commands. This is a heavily restricted form of Semagrams; unlike the full version it is not connected to a running Julia repl, so you can't save diagrams or change the schema; it is stuck to the schema for directed port graphs. If you are intrigued by this demo, however, I encourage you to try out the real thing!
